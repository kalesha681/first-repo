# First C Programs Repository

This repository contains all the C programs I created while learning the basics of C programming. Each file demonstrates a different concept, exercise, or project from my learning journey.

## Contents
The repository includes:
- Basic syntax and structure examples
- Programs using variables, constants, and input/output
- Control flow: if/else, switch, loops (while, for)
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers and memory management
- Small projects and quizzes

## How to Compile and Run
To compile any C file, use a C compiler like GCC. For example, to compile `01_Basics.c`:

```sh
gcc 01_Basics.c -o 01_Basics.exe
```

Then run the executable:

```sh
./01_Basics.exe
```

Repeat for other files by changing the filename.
